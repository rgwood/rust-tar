# rust-tar

A Rust implementation of the [tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html) archive utility. 

## Should I use this?

Probably not. The tar binary that came with your OS is much more full-featured.

## So what's it good for?

Building a tool like this is a really good way to learn Rust. 10/10 would recommend.
